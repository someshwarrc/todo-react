# Building a React Todo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The todo app uses localstorage to store the todo list such that data persists. Basic uses of React hooks - useState, useEffect.

Check out the working todo app [here](https://someshwarrc.github.io/todo-react).
